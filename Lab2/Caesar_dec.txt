I'm really sorry that I can't tell you the name of this little man, and where he lives, and who his dad and mom are. I didn't even get a good look at his face in the dark. I only remember that his nose was freckled and that his pants were short and held not on a strap, but on straps that fall over his shoulders and fasten somewhere on his stomach.

One summer I went to a kindergarten, I do not know what it is called, on Vasilyevsky Island, near the white church. I had an interesting book with me, I stayed too late, read too much and did not notice how the evening came.
